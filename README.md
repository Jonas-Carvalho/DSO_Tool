# DSO Tool
## What Is DSO ?
DSO stands for Days Sales Outstanding.

It's a metric of how many days a company will receive the $ (cash) after it main operation sales.

## Why It Matters?
Time is money, dot.

Financial assets are time dependent and, consequently, money value range throughout time.
With that in mind, businesses pick between use it into stock/bonds or reinvest on its main operation. So, earlier you get the money, better to raise capital.

It is reasonable that a low DSO means free cash flow. And free cash flow means more working capital.

## How is it done?

DSO = (AR collection / Revenue ) * 90 days
